# Camden
Hello!

My name is Camden, I help out at [Stellanode](https://discord.gg/gyEFdG4eAB), most of my work is closed source, though I try to put some things on here. 

I am currently working on builing [spot micro](https://github.com/mike4192/spotMicro), so far I have the frame made, and the legs working.
